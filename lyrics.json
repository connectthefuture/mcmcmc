it\nAnd when your number comes for service then they send it in\nNow your time has arrived for your final test\nI see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath\nHow much longeer will it be til it's all done?\nTotal darkness and ease be in all one\nI watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate\nYou took his life, but your memory he'll never take\nYou'll be heade to another place\nAnd the

but you'll still die\nNow your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears\nThe rigormortis starts to set, now you outta here\nYou start your journey into outer space\nYou see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place\nSo you standing in the tunnel of eternal light,\nAnd you see the ones you never learn to love in life\nMake the choice let it go but u can back it up\nIf you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up\nBut if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free\nThere lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace\n\nI still got to wondah why,\nI

grows, huh\n18 years younger than my mama\nBut I really got beatings cause the girl loved drama\nIn single parenthood there I stood\nBy the time she was 21, had another one\nThis one's a girl, let's name her Pam\nSame father as the first but you don't give a damn\nIrresponsible, plain not thinking\nPapa said chill but the brother keep winking\nStill he won't down you or tear out your hide\nOn your side while the baby maker slide\nBut mama got wise to the game\nThe youngest of five kids, hon here it is\nAfter 10 years without no spouse\nMomma's gettin married in the house\nListen, positive

see\nTook me from a boy to a man so I always had a father\nWhen my biological didn't bother\nTaking care of this so who am I to bicker\nNot a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver\nBut you can never say that his life is through\n5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too\nHere we go while I check the scene\nWith the Portugese lover at the age of 14\nThe same age, front page, no fuss\nBut I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us\nNever been senile, that's where you're wrong\nBut give the man a taste and he's gone\nNoddin off, sleep to a jazz tune\nI can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room\nI get the pillow and hope I don't wake him\nFor this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim\nTelling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over\nI said pop maybe when you're older\nWe laughed all night about the hookers at the party\nMy old man standing yelling good God, almighty\nUse your condom, take sips of the brew\nWhen they reminisce over you, for real\n\n[Pete

the ladies, that make the babies\nAnd since a man can't make one\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\nSo will the real men get up\nI know you're fed up ladies, but keep your

enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with the local crew, and had a smoke or two\nAnd I realize momma really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life, to raise me right\nAnd all I had ta give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen\nI'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent\nAnd in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen\nI try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind\nLast night my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity\nIt seems tha rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up\nYou know it's funny when it rains and pours\nThey got money for wars, but can't feed the poor\nThey say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is\nthere ain't no hope for tha future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy\nI blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack

know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome\nThank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em\nCause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm

in?)yea\n\nHere we go,\nOnce upon a time not long ago,\nwhen people wore pajamas and lived life slow,\nWhen laws were stern and justice stood,\nand people were behavin' like they ought to good,\nThere lived a lil' boy who was misled,\nby another lil' boy and this is what he said:\n\"Me, You, Ty, we gonna make some cash,\nrobbin' old folks and makin' ah dash\",\nThey did the job, money came with ease,\nbut one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease,\nHe robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha,\ntried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover,\nThe cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic,\nhe said \"Keep still, boy, no need for static\",\nPunched him in his belly and he gave him a slap,\nbut little did he know the lil' boy was strapped,\nThe kid pulled out a gun, he said \"Why'd ya hit me?\",\nthe barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney,\nThe cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure,\n\"I'll do years if I pull this trigga\",\nSo he cold dashed and ran around the block,\ncop radioes it to another lady cop,\nHe ran by a tree, there he saw this sista,\na shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her,\nLooked around good and from expectations,\nso he decided he'd hit for the subway stations,\nBut she was coming and he made a left,\nhe was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath,\nKnocked an old man down and swore he killed him,(sorry)\nthen he made his move to an abandoned building,\nRan up the stairs up to the top floor,\nopened up the door there, guess who he saw?,\nDave the dope fiend shootin' dope,\nwho don't know the meaning of water nor soap,\nHe said(I need bullets, hurry up, run)\nthe dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun,\nHe went outside but there was cops all over,\nthen he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova,\nRaced up the block doing 83,\ncrashed into a tree near university,\nEscaped alive though the car was battered,\nrat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered,\nRan out of bullets and still had static,\ngrabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic,\nPointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead,\nhe told the cops(Back off or honey here's dead),\nDeep in his heart he knew he was wrong,\nso he let the lady go and he starts to run on,\nSirens sounded, he seemed astounded,\nbefore long the lil' boy got surrounded,\nHe dropped the gun, so went the glory,\nand this is the way I must end this story,\nHe was only seventeen, in a madman's dream,\nthe cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream,\nThis ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh,\njust another case 'bout the wrong

million\nbeing the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nhe used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams\na corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen\nnigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nshe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nher son's heart simultaneously grew colder\nhe started hanging out selling bags in the projects\nchecking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects\nhe was fascinated by material objects\nbut he understood money never bought respect\nhe built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal\nbut got locked once, and didn't hesitate to squeal\nso criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real\nyou see me and niggaz like this have never been equal\nI dont project my insecurities at other people\nhe fiended for

trying to be trife never face the consequences\nyou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nask a nigga doing life if he had another chance\nbut then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance\ndance forever with the devil on a cold cell block\nbut thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock\ndevils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top\nthere's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do\nhe'd get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew\nstarting fights over little shit, up on the block\nstepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock\nworking overtime for making money for the crack spot\nhit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine\nfulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\ntired of the block niggaz treating him the same\nhe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nbut when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love\nthey told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs\nany bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nany nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood\neven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club\nbut only a real thug can stab someone till they die\nstanding in front of them, staring straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well guarded\nand they wanted to test him, before business started\nsuggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted\nso now he had a choice between going back to his life\nor making money with made men, up in the cife\nhis dreams about cars and ice, made him agree\na hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nand so he met them friday night at a quarter to three\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was raining\nsmoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment\nuntil they saw a woman on the street walking alone\nthree in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home\nand so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nwalking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nthey wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor\nthis is it kid now you got your chance to be raw\nso Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nand dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nshe struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs\nthey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nscreaming 'shut the fuck up' and 'stop moving around'\nthe shirt covered her face, but she screamed to the clouds\nso Billy stomped on the bitch, until he'd broken her jaw\nthe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing\nthey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving\nblood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently\nand then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn\nripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned\na broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned\nwhen they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised\none of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two\nthey told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through\nand if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nhe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nand so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n\n(Sample from \"Survival of the Fittest\" by Mobb Deep)\nI'm falling and I can't turn back\nI'm falling and I can't turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life\nhe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nand he felt strong standing along with his new brothers\ncocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover\nbut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\ncause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother\nshe looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her\nshe cried more painfully than when they were raping her\nhis whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate\nhis corruption had succesfully changed his fate\nand he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nworking hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth\nhe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nand crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared\nbut only the devil responded, cause god wasn't there\nand right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nand so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nthey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nafter that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nand listen cause the story that I'm telling is true\ncause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too\nand now the devil follows me everywhere that I go\nin fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows\nand every street cypher listening to little thugs flow\nhe could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know\nthe devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nwhite, brown, yellow and black, color is not restricted\nyou have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted\nand you'll be one of god's children and fall from the top\nthere's no

wreck\nI used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive\nWhen I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5\nI drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it\nWit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\nNasty Nas has to rise, cause i'm wise\nThis is exercise til the microphone dies\nBack in '83, I was an MC sparking\nBut I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and\nKick my little raps cuz I thought niggaz wouldn't understand\nAnd now in every jam I'm the fucking man\nI rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships\nI used to watch C.H.I.P.S, now I load glock clips\nI got to have it, I miss Mr Magic\nVersatile, my style switches like a faggot\nBut not a bisexual, I'm an intellectual\nOf rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo\nThese are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand\nCuz in the streets, I'm well known like the number man\nAm I in place wit the bass and format?\nExplore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that\nAnd next time I rhyme, I be foul whenever I freestyle\nI see trial niggaz say I'm wow\nI hate a rhymebiter's rhyme\nStay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime\n\nRight...\nIt's halftime\n\nI got it going on, even flip 'em on this song\nEvery afternoon, I kick half the tune\nAnd in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the narcs hit\nWord to marcus Garvey or heartless Sparkton\nCuz when I blast the herb, that's my word\nI be slaying them fast, doing this, that and the third\nBut chill, pass the Andre and let's lay\nI bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a mantinee\nPutting hits on 5-0\nCuz when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo-fo [44]\nAnd biters can't come near\nAnd yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia\nI won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed\nThat's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed\nThis goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten\nBrooklyn, Queens is living fat and\nThe Boogie Down, enuff props, enuff clout\nIll will, rest in peace, yo, I'm

thousand police cars\nBarely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck\nJumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck\nBut I think somebody seen me maybe\nPlus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby\nFuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits\nCame out with a white flag hollerin' TRUCE TRUCE!\nSurrendered my weapon to cops\nWasn't me!

sad\nLiving out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has\nAnd over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy\nGuess she's given birth to a baby\nI don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan\nWe jump into another form of slavery\nEven now I keep discouraged\nWonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage\nI refuse to be a role model\nI set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle\nI make mistakes, but learn from every one\nAnd when its said and done\nI bet this Brotha be a better one\nIf I'm upset, you don't stress\nNever forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet\nI feel his hand on my brain\nWhen I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang\nBut am I less holy\nCuz I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies\nBefore we find world peace\nWe gotta find peace in that war on the streets\nMy ghetto gospel\n\n[Chorus - Elton John:]\nThose who wish to follow me (Yeah My ghetto gospel)\nI welcome with my

states through the use of mental alchemy\nI climbed the Tower of Babylon and through rappers of the balcony\nMy culture showers me, the microphone overpowers me\nSeparates me from rappers who use actions that are cowardly\nThat's how it be, hip-hop amazes me worships, praises me\nResembles favours me, allows me many ways to freak\nSeven styles for seven days a week\nAllows me to transform like soundwave and give up more tapes than Laser Beak\nThe things you see in life hip-hop provides you, over-rides you\nLet the spirit of hip-hop get up inside you\nThere was a shoulder to lead on, but I had the one to cry to\nHelp me pick up the pieces made me hot enough to fly through\nTried to fly through, jacking me for my faculty\nHalf of these emcees get lost in space like Dr. Zachary\nI jetted for the goal-line A and R's kept trying to tackle me\nSacked me and grappled me, I was the righteous of an athlete\nAt first I was alone now there's a 1000 kids that backing me\nFinally got a deal and now the CIA are tracking me\nI didn't mean to do it socialism just came naturally\nI think it's time to meditate, my sentiments exactly\n\n\n(Verse 3)\n\nIn the world filled with petulance and hatred\nSome say we'll be rescued by spaceships\nI stay away from crooks and study books by the ages\nWhen the world gets to crazy hip-hop helps me escape it\nNo gravity I am weightless, broke from poverty to greatness\nI create this and built this, kid rackets smelt the fragrance\nOne love, One blood I got rhymes buried in my platelage\nYou can state this, crease this, place this with emphasis\nNow enter this, take shots like Islamic fundamentalists\nDegenerate rappers I'm smashing attackin' with a passion\nA-and-R-bashin', ripping lyrics built on fashion\nNow imagine you just won a trip around my way\nFull transportation all expenses paid\nI've never been a player just the one who got played\nNow my style kills more kids then Rouge versus Wade\nDon't be afraid to join us on this hip-hop meditation\nWhere you encounter evil spirits, release hip-hop and let it chase them\nAnd place them over here, forget the clothes that you be wearing\nMy style is matter free, I'm free but don't you go comparing\nYour weekly shopping-sprees versus my bargain basement shopping\nYour religion versus my black magic concoction\nTae-quando and boxing, moving soldiers to my locksmith\nYour biodegradable rhymes to my lethal toxin\nRhyming is a gift and not an option\nI gave birth to more styles then half you emcees got through adoption\nBe careful of the lyrics and the

The companies want something done about this sluggish world economic situation... Profits have been running a little thin lately and we need to stimulate some growth... Now we know there's an alarming high number of young people roaming around in your country with nothing to do but stir up trouble for the police and damage private property. It doesn't look like they'll ever get a job... It's about time we did something constructive with these people... We've got thousands of 'em here too. They're crawling all over... The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together - and start another war... The president? He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro... Napalm... People running down the road, skin on fire... The Soviets seem up for it... The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. Hell, Afghanistan's no fun... So whadya say?... We don't even have to win this war. We just want to cut down on some of this excess population... Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic riffle and send 'em on their way... Libya? El Salvador? How 'bout Northern Ireland? Or a 'moderately repressive regime' in South America? We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story in the Middle East - we need that oil... We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad didn't even show up. I tell ya... that man is unreliable. The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one... Now just think for a minute - we can make this war so big - so BIG... The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper... We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queues if we plan this right. Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls... Now don't worry about those demonstrators - just pump up your drug supply. So many people have hooked themselves on heroin and amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. Kept the war functioning just fine... It's easy. We've got our college kids so interested in beer they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, they wouldn't even know what it looked like... So how 'bout it? Look - war is money. The arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production the whole economy is going to collapse... The Soviets are in the same boat. We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say?!?... That's excellent.

lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers\nI'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket\nBut the niggaz around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me\nThey wanna be me and my family too\nBecause the
