the world ever seen\nhe used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams\na corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen\nnigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nshe put the pipe down but for every year she was sober\nher sons heart simultaneously grew colder\nhe started hanging out selling bags in the projects\nchecking the young chicks looking for hit and run prospects\nhe was fascinated by material objects\nbut he understood money never bought respect\nhe built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal\nbut got locked once and didnt hesitate to squeal\nso criminals he chilled with didnt think he was real\nyou see me and niggaz like this have never been equal\ni dont project my insecurities at other people\nhe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nso he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\na feeble minded young man with infinite potetial\nthe product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental\ncoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\ndancing with the devil smoked until his eyes would bleed\nbut he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed\neveryone trying to be trife never face the consequences\nyou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nask a nigga doing life if he had another chance\nbut then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance\ndance forever with the devil on a cold cell block\nbut thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock\ndevils used to be gods angels that fell from the top\ntheres no diversity because were burning in the melting pot\nso billy started robbing niggaz anything he could do\nhed get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nstarting fights over little shit up on the block\nstepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock\nworking overtime for making money for the crack spot\nhit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine\nfulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\ntired of the block niggaz treating him the same\nhe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nbut when he tried to step to em niggaz showed him no love\nthey told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs\nany bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nany nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood\neven puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club\nbut only a real thug can stab someone till they die\nstanding in front of them staring straight into their eyes\nbilly realized that these men were well guarded\nand they wanted to test him before business started\nsuggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted\nso now he had a choice between going back to his life\nor making money with made men up in the cife\nhis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\na hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nand so he met them friday night at a quarter to three\nthey drove around the projects slow while it was raining\nsmoking blunts drinking and joking for entertainment\nuntil they saw a woman on the street walking alone\nthree in the morning coming back from work on her way home\nand so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nwalking through the projects the darkness swallowed her\nthey wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor\nthis is it kid now you got your chance to be raw\nso billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nand dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nshe struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs\nthey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nscreaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around\nthe shirt covered her face but she screamed to the clouds\nso billy stomped on the bitch until hed broken her jaw\nthe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing\nthey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving\nblood leaking through the cloth she cried silently\nand then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nbilly was meant to go first but each of them took a turn\nripping her up and choking her until her throat burned\na broken jaw mumbled for god but they werent concerned\nwhen they were done and she was lying bloody broken and bruised\none of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twentytwo\nthey told him that she was a witness of what shed gone through\nand if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nhe thought about it for a minute she was practically dead\nand so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\nim falling and i cant turn back\nim falling and i cant turn back\nright before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nhe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nand he felt strong standing along with his new brothers\ncocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nbut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\ncause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother\nshe looked back at him and cried cause he had forsaken her\nshe cried more painfully than when they were raping her\nhis whole world stopped he couldnt even contemplate\nhis corruption had succesfully changed his fate\nand he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nworking hard for nothing cause now what was he worth\nhe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nand crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared\nbut only the devil responded cause god wasnt there\nand right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nand so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nthey say death takes you to a better place but i doubt it\nafter that they killed his mother and never spoke about it\nand listen cause the story that im telling is true\ncause i was there with billy jacobs and i raped his mom too\nand now the devil follows me everywhere that i go\nin fact im sure hes standing among one of you at my shows\nand every street cypher listening to little thugs flow\nhe could be standing right next to you and you wouldnt know\nthe devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nwhite brown yellow and black color is not restricted\nyou have a self destructive destiny when youre inflicted\nand youll be one of gods children and fall from the top\ntheres no diversity because were burning in the melting pot\nso when the devil wants to dance with you you better say never\nbecause the dance with the devil might last you forever"},{"artist":"

stockpile in their back yard they wouldnt even know what it looked like so how bout it look  war is money the arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production the
